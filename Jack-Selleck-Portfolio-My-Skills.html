											<p>
											I am fast at prototyping and am knowledgeable in implementing optimized gameplay elements<br />
											I make sure to keep my code readable with comments and good naming conventions.<br />
											To see my coding expertise in more detail, please check the games in the "My games" section of the website</p>

												<h2><a href="Rhythm-Game-Unity.html" target= ""> Rhythm games from any song</h2></a>

													<strong><a href="Rhythm-Game-Unity.html" target= ""> More info on my Procedurally Generated rhythm game</a> <p></p></strong>
		
										
													<li> A rhythm game which takes any audio of the players choice and creates a rhythm game level out of it, also allows for difficulty scaling. <li>
													 I am currently recreating creating this system in unreal engine to test my skills in porting code into new languages and engines <li>
													 Code i am proud of includes the code to analyse the audio, and then use its spectrum data to spawn notes in time with the song <li>
													 I am also proud of the code which detects the correct delay before the audio plays, so the notes reach the clicking area in time with the beat no matter
													 the song or note speed

												 <li>An action game where you must defeat a horde of crab people, and then the crab king <li>
												 3D enemy path finding and logic is used for the enemies, only chasing you once you've entered their line of sight <li>
												 Features sword fighting mechanics with parrying, slashes and long attacks <li>
												 My favorite code in this game is the boss fight logic where the player is transported to a bullet hell scene<li>
												 I am also proud of the final bullet hell scene, where the attacks are very turbulent and surprising </li>

										 <h1>Teamwork </h1>
										  I greatly enjoy collaborating on projects with a team, especially on a subject I am passionate about like game development.		
										<!-- <br> i have been a member of successful game jams and give help to classmates when needed		-->						  			  
										 <br>I know how to bring up my teams spirit and push ideas, and like to be friendly with the team
										 <br> I take feedback well and am happy to make changes to my code and designs if necessary
									
								<section class="post">
									<header class="major">
										<p></p>
										 <p></p>
										<h1>Work ethic</h1> 
										I know how to push myself to crunch out games in time for deadlines and handle it well, finding joy in the process of learning and creating<br />
										For example whilst developing "Krungus" which i made in 3 weeks, i spent upwards of 10 hours a day coding and designing for the final two weeks <br />

										<p></p>
										<!--Through my time as the lead developer for my university classes final project, "game name here" and participant of a number of game jams i have learnt alot about how teams function, how to communitcate well and being honest with fellow developers <br />-->

										<h1>Other skills </h1>											
											<p> Other skills which may be of use despite not being my primary role        
											<p> I am experienced in high quality pixel art from my time developing my in progress personal project "DEEPER"

												<h3>Planning cinematic scenes </h3>
												<p></p> I have created a character concept and animatic to be used as a plan for a 3D animation <p></p>
																					
													<p> Character design, this is a plan for the 3D model ensuring all features are consistent across angles
													<div class ="image main"><img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-13 055800.png" alt="Image" /></div>
													
													<br> The animatic, a rough plan for the video showing how the scenes will go and match the themetune <br>
