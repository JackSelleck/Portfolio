									<h1>Coding<br />
									C++, C#</h1>
									<p>All games listed are solo projects<br />
									I am fast at prototyping and am knowledgeable in optimized coding<br />
									I make sure to keep my code readable with comments and good naming conventions.<br />
								    To see my coding expertise in more detail, please check the games in the "My games" section of the website</p>
									
										<h3>Things I am most proud of coding</h3>
										<h4>Procedurally Generated Rhythm game</h4> <p></p>
											
										<video width="768" height="=1366" preload="auto" src="images/Rhythm Game.mp4" controls>				
										Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
										<a href="images/Robot Girl Animatic.mp4">link to the video</a> instead. </video>
										<li>
										 A rhythm game which takes any audio of the players choice and creates a rhythm game level out of it, also allows for difficulty scaling. <li>
					                     I am currently recreating creating this system in unreal engine to test my skills in porting code into new languages and engines <li>
										 Code i am proud of includes the code to analyse the audio, and then use its spectrum data to spawn notes in time with the song <li>
										 I am also proud of the code which detects the correct delay before the audio plays, so the notes are in time with the song no matter
										 the song or note speed
										 
										 <br><a href="Rhythm-Game-Unity.html" target= "_blank"> More info on my Procedurally Generated rhythm game</a>
										 <p></p>
										 <h4>Krungus</h4>
										 An action game where you must defeat a horde of crab people, and then the crab king <li>
										 My favorite code in this game is the boss fight logic where it swaps between scenes and determines when the boss dies<li>
									     3D enemy path finding and logic is used for the crab enemies, only chasing you once you've entered their line of sight <li>
										 Features sword fighting mechanics with parrying, slashes and long attacks </li>
										 
										 <p></p>
										 <h4> miscellaneous </h4>
										A save and load system in Unity using<a href="https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp" target= "_blank"> MessagePack</a>, a faster alternative to JSON

										 <p></p>
										 <p></p>
										 <h1>Teamwork </h1>
										  I greatly enjoy collaborating on projects with a team, especially with a subject I am passionate about like game development.										  			  
										 <br>I know how to bring up my teams spirit and push ideas, and like to be friendly with the team
										 <br> I take feedback well and am happy to make changes to my code and designs if necessary
									
								<section class="post">
									<header class="major">
										<p></p>
										 <p></p>
										<h1>Work ethic</h1> 
										I know how to push myself to crunch out games in time for deadlines and handle it well, finding joy in the process of learning and creating<br />
										For example whilst developing "Krungus" which i made in 3 weeks, i spent upwards of 10 hours a day coding and designing for the final two weeks <br />

										<p></p>
										<!--Through my time as the lead developer for my university classes final project, "game name here" and participant of a number of game jams i have learnt alot about how teams function, how to communitcate well and being honest with fellow developers <br />-->

										<h1>Other skills </h1>											
											<p> Other skills which may be of use despite not being my primary role        
											<p> I am experienced in high quality pixel art from my time developing in progress my personal project "DEEPER"

												<h3>Planning cinematic scenes </h3>
												<p></p> I have created a character concept and animatic to be used as a plan for a 3D animation <p></p>
																					
													<p> Character design, this is a plan for the 3D model ensuring all features are consistent across angles

													<br> The animatic, a rough plan for the video showing how the scenes will go and match the themetune <br>
