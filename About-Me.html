					<!--<span class="image left"><img src="Webp/SelfieForBizOG - SMALL - Copy.webp" alt="" /></span>-->
					I am Jack Selleck, I am currently on the second year of my game development degree and have wanted to make games since I was a child.<br />
					I have already made a variety of games ranging from my procedurally generating rhythm game, my action game "Krungus", and my in-progress RPG "Deeper"; as well as a shooter and story game, which were made too early in my game development career to feature on my Portfolio.<br />
					My primary aspiration in my game development career is to be a gameplay engineer, but I also like pixel art.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="Gifs/MaxFall.gif" alt="Animated character" /></span>
					As of now, I am at the top of my class and always put full effort towards my assignments.<br />
					When I make a game I am always sure to finish it, and bring it to a standard which reflects my current skill level.<br />
					When I am not making games, I am often playing them, or spending time with friends. My favorite games to play are games where I can play against friends, story games, rhythm games, exploration games, and competitive games.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also like to learn and research new things. Right now my main focus is getting better at C++, and expanding my knowledge on C# through industry-standard game programming patterns, as it seems like a good challenge and a logical next step in my game development career.<br />
					I'm also interested in creating my own coding language and game engine.
