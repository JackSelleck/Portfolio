									I am Jack Selleck, I am currently on the second year of my game development degree and have wanted to make games since i was a child. <br>
									I have already made a variety of games ranging from my procedurally generating rhythm game, my action game "Krungus", and my in progress RPG "Deeper";
									as well as a shooter and story game, which were made too early in my game development career to feature on my Portfolio. <br>
									My primary aspiration in my game development career is to be a gameplay engineer, but I also like pixel art. 										                           
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/MaxFall.gif" alt="" /></span>As of now, I am at the top of my class and always put full effort towards my assignments. <br>
						        	When I make a game I am always sure to finish it, and bring it to a standard which reflects my current skill level. <br>
									When I am not making games, I am often playing them, or spending time with friends.	My favorite games to play are games where I can play against friends, Story games,
								    Rhythm games, Exploration games and Competitive games. <p>
										
									I also like to learn and research new things, right now my main focus is getting better at C++, and expanding my knowledge on C# through industry standard game programming patterns, as it seems like
									a good challenge and a logical next step in my game development career. <br>
									Im also interested in creating my own coding language and game engine.
									<br>
