					<h3>Features</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>3D enemy pathfinding and logic</li>
						<li>First person melee combat with parrying, long attacks and slashes, and Undertale-inspired bullet hell scenes</li>
						<li>Tested to run at a smooth 60fps with VSync on lower mid-end devices (tested on Radeon Pro 560, Intel i5 7th gen)</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Feedback</h3>
					<p>
						Feedback from my programming professor was that Krungus is very polished for a solo project in my first year. My grade on this project was 94.
					</p>

					<h3>Code Explanation</h3>
					<h4>Boss fight</h4>
					<p>
						A key part of this boss fight was switching to Undertale-esque bullet hell scenes. I combined this with classic boss fight
						mechanics which appear in Mario games, where you hit a boss out of its stun phase three times to defeat it.
						Here is a concise explanation of how it worked:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If the player collides with the boss attack, the <code>ScenesToLoad</code> int is increased by 1</li>
						<li>Further collisions are deemed invalid for a time to stop this int accidentally being increased by more than 1 per hit</li>
						<li>This int is used to determine which bullet hell fight is loaded, for instance if int = 2 then scene 2 is loaded</li>
						<li>This results in the player being transported into three scenes in total throughout the boss fight, the 3rd being the final</li>
						<li>I detect when the new scene ends and transport the player and boss back to the original scene</li>
						<li>Now that the bullet hell scene has been completed, the boss is put into a stun phase, allowing it to be attacked</li>
						<li>Three attacks remove it from its stun phase, then once the boss is hit out of its stun phase three times, it is killed</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What I would have done differently based on my observations of playtesters</h3>
					<p>
						My playtesters did not know to use the block move which made them struggle much more than necessary.
						To aid this, I would have added an immersive tutorial, such as a tip when the game starts, showing the player how important the block move is.
					</p>

					<h3>Other things I would have done differently</h3>
					<p>
						I believe that since I was spending all of my time developing Krungus (10∼ hours a day for 2 weeks), it was harder for me to recognize any flaws with the game since I had become used to them.
						Coming back to the game today, I recognize flaws which I was blind to during development. This experience made me understand the importance of playtesters for commercial games.<br />
						The assets I used were very unoptimized; however, this experience taught me a lot about optimizing my code so I could keep it playable for lower-end devices.
						When Unity 6 came out, I updated the game with its new optimization features which further increased frame rates.
